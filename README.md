# Seed & Grain Website

## Description

The Seed & Grain website is a project developed as a didactic demonstration for a public contest I am participating in here in Brazil, aiming for a position as a university professor. Serving as a didactic tool, the website provides a convenient platform to access information and exercises related to the subjects I might teach if selected as a professor. I aspire to secure a favorable position in this contest.
